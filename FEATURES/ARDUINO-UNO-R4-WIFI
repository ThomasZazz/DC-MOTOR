 Arduino Wiring Explanation 

The Arduino board used is an Arduino UNO R4 WIFI, which serves as the central controller for reading sensor data, controlling the motor, and handling display/output.

 
Arduino Pin Connections

|        Arduino Pin       |             Connected To                      |            Purpose                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
|  D6 (PWM_MOTOR)          | Motor Driver (PWM pin)                        | Controls motor speed via PWM        |
|  D3 (MOTOR_DIRECTION)    | Motor Driver (IN1/IN2)                        | Controls motor rotation direction   |
|  D7 (ENABLE_RIGHT)       | Motor Driver (ENA)                            | Enables right side of H-bridge      |
|  D8 (ENABLE_LEFT)        | Motor Driver (ENB)                            | Enables left side of H-bridge       |
|  A0 (VOLTAGE_PIN)        | Voltage Sensor output                         | Reads analog voltage from the motor |
|  A3 (CURRENT_PIN)        | Current Sensor output                         | Reads analog current from the motor |
|  D13 (EMERGENCY_BUTTON)  | Emergency Stop Button (to GND when pressed)   | Detects emergency stop signal       |
|  SDA/SCL                 | LCD via I2C module                            | Communicates with LCD display       |
|  GND                     | Connected to all GNDs (sensors, driver, etc.) | Ensures common ground               |
| 5V                       | Powers LCD and possibly sensors (low power)   | Provides regulated 5V power         |


 I2C LCD Display (16x2)

 Connected to SDA and SCL (I2C pins)
 Powered via 5V and GND from Arduino
 Used to show real-time values: voltage, current, power, status

The LCD uses the hd44780 I2C backpack , which allows communication using only  two data lines .


 Sensor Inputs

A0: receives analog signal from the voltage divider or voltage sensor
A3: receives analog signal from the current sensor 
Both are processed using calibration constants in code to convert raw readings into real-world values.


Emergency Button

 Connected to D13
 Configured as INPUT_PULLUP, so it goes LOW when pressed
 Used to immediately shut off the motor and halt operation
