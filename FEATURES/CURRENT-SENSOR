 Current Sensor (ACS712) Wiring


Location in the Hardware

The ACS712 module is located at the bottom right of the board in the image. It has:

A green screw terminal (for high current connections),
A 3-pin header for low-voltage connections (VCC, GND, OUT).


  Electrical Connections

VCC              +5V rail on the breadboard               
GND              Ground rail on the breadboard            
 OUT             Connected to `A3` on the Arduino         
 IP+ / IPâˆ’       In series between motor and power supply 


 How it Works

1. The high-current path (through the green screw terminals) connects the power supply to the motor, so all motor current passes through the sensor.
2. The sensor outputs a voltage proportional to the current, centered at 2.5V when no current flows.
3. The analog signal from the OUT pin is read by the Arduino on analog pin A3.
4. The Arduino processes this value using the following code:

cpp
float currentReading = analogRead(CURRENT_PIN);
float currentVoltage = currentReading * VCC / ADC_RESOLUTION;
float current = (currentVoltage - ZERO_CURRENT_VOLTAGE) / CURRENT_SENSITIVITY;
if (current < 0.0) current = 0.0;


 ZERO_CURRENT_VOLTAGE is the sensor output at 0 A (typically \~2.5V).
 CURRENT_SENSITIVIT` depends on the model (e.g., 0.066 V/A for ACS712-30A).


Tips for Reliable Operation

 Ensure screw terminals are tightly fastened to handle motor current.
 Use thick wires for high-current paths.
 Double-check that GND is common across Arduino, sensor, and motor driver.
 Keep analog wires (e.g. OUT to A3) short and separated from high-current cables to reduce noise.
