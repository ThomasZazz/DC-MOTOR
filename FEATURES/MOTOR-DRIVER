 Motor Driver Wiring


Motor Driver Overview

The motor driver module allows the Arduino to:

Control the rotation direction of the DC motor.
Adjust the motor speed using PWM.
Isolate power between the control logic and motor circuitry.


 Electrical Connections

|       Driver Pin        |        Connected To             |                  Purpose                               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|  IN1 / IN2              | Arduino D3                      | Motor direction control (HIGH/LOW)                     |
| ENA / ENB               | Arduino D7 and D8               | Enable signals for right and left H-bridge sides       |
| PWM                     | Arduino D6                      | PWM signal to adjust motor speed                       |
| OUT1 / OUT2             | Motor terminals                 | Outputs to DC motor                                    |
| 12V IN (Screw Terminal) | External 12V power supply       | Powers the motor via the H-Bridge                      |
| GND                     | Shared with Arduino & power     | Common ground                                          |


Power Supply Wiring

 The 12V input terminal is connected to an external 12V DC power supply.
 The GND of the driver is wired to the Arduino GND and power supply GND.
 This ensures a shared ground reference for both logic and power systems.


 Motor Output Wiring

 The OUT1 a nd  OUT2  terminals are wired to the DC motor terminals (typically using red and blue wires).
 This setup allows the driver to change the polarity of the motor voltage, thereby controlling its direction.


 Control Signals from Arduino

|   Arduino Pin    |   Motor Driver Pin   |   Function                           |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
|  D3              |  IN1 / IN2           | Sets the motor rotation direction    |
|  D6              |  PWM                 | Controls motor speed via PWM         |
|  D7              |  ENA                 | Enables one side of the H-Bridge     |
|  D8              |  ENB                 | Enables the other side of H-Bridge   |

In the Arduino code:
  digitalWrite(D3, HIGH/LOW) changes the motor direction.
  analogWrite(D6, value) adjusts speed.
  D7 and D8 must be set HIGH to enable motor motion.


 Notes and Tips

 Always share GND between Arduino, motor driver, and power supply.
 If your motor driver has jumpers on ENA/ENB, remove them to control enable pins via Arduino.
 Use thick wires for the motor and power input to handle higher current.
 Keep logic signal wires short (D3, D6, D7, D8) to avoid interference.
