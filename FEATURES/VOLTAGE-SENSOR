 Voltage Sensor Wiring


Connections Overview

 1. Input Terminal Block (Green screw terminal)

This is where the voltage to be measured is applied.

 `+` — Connected to the **positive terminal of the power supply** (e.g., motor supply, 12V).
 `–` — Connected to **GND** (shared with the system ground).

 2. **Output Pins (3-pin header)**

These pins connect the module to the Arduino for power and data.

`VCC` — Connected to **Arduino 5V** (module power supply).
`GND` — Connected to **Arduino GND**.
`OUT` — Connected to **Arduino analog pin A0**, to read the scaled-down voltage.

 Notes

The voltage sensor works by scaling down the input voltage using a resistive divider.
 Make sure your input voltage does **not exceed the sensor’s rated input** (typically 25V max).
 You must apply a **calibration factor** in your code to convert the analog reading to real voltage:

cpp
const float VOLTAGE_RATIO = 4.40; // Adjust based on your module’s divider ratio
